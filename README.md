## Welcome and Project Objectives

This project is designed to facilitate visualization of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2017-2018. Specifically, this project focuses on associations between different exposures and oral health-related outcomes. Exposures investigated include: gender, age, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, and disability status. Outcomes were oral health utilization, self-reported oral health status, and examiner-assessed oral health status.

Project Objectives:
- Gain a better understanding of the distribution of oral health related outcomes.
- Investigate differences between outcomes based on different exposures.
- Establish a foundation to further explore discrepancies between outcomes of oral health utilization, subjective oral health status, and objective (clinician-assessed) oral health status.

### NHANES Background

Initiated in 1960, NHANES is a cross-sectional survey using a complex sampling design in order to be representative of the non-institutionalized United States population. Compared with other national surveys, NHANES collects information through in-person survey questionnaires, physical examination, and laboratory testing.

Survey Data Collection:
- Individual questionnaire: medical history, risk factors, physical functioning, dietary data
- Family questionnaire: demographics, income, insurance
- Computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI): health status, physical activity, reproductive health, alcohol/tobacco
- Audio computer-assisted self interview (CASI): alcohol, drugs, sexual behavior


Frequently Asked Questions:
- How many individals participate? *Approximately 34,000 are interviewed and 21,000 examined.*
- What is the response rate? *85% for interviews and 78% for exams. These are relatively high!*
- How is the complex sampling design accounted for in the analysis? *Survey procedures need to be used in statistical analysis, so weights are applied to the data to provide unbiased national estimates.*
- What are the main limitations of this data? *Since the data is cross-sectional, causality can't be determined. Information may be subject to recall bias. Sample sizes for certain variables may be small.*


## Context of Oral Health
Dental caries (cavities) and periodontal disease (gum disease), the two most common dental problems, are largely preventable. More than 1 in 4 US adults have untreated cavities, and almost half have gum disease.

Robust evidence shows how a lack of dental care can result in nutritional problems and chronic pain. Research focusing on the oral-overall health connection demonstrates associations between oral infections and cardiovascular disease, bacterial pneumonia, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and diabetes. Effects of dental disease also extend beyond direct health effects. Adults with cavities or missing teeth are often self-conscious about their appearance, which can decrease social participation and make it harder to find and hold a job.

In the United States, there are grim disparities in who can access dental services. Unsurprisingly, underserved populations are disproportionately affected, including low-income communities, non-white Americans, people with disabilities, and older adults. Cost is the most significant barrier preventing access to dental care.
