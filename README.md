## Welcome and Project Objectives

This project is designed to facilitate visualization of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2017-2018.

### NHANES Background

Initiated in 1960, NHANES is a cross-sectional survey and is representative of the non-institutionalized United States population. Compared with other national surveys, NHANES collects information through in-person survey questionnaires, physical examination, and laboratory testing.

Survey Data Collection:
- Individual questionnaire: medical history, risk factors, physical functioning, dietary data
- Family questionnaire: demographics, income, insurance
- Computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI): health status, physical activity, reproductive health, alcohol/tobacco
- Audio computer-assisted self interview (CASI): alcohol, drugs, sexual behavior

Frequently Asked Questions:
- How many individals participate? *Approximately 34,000 are interviewed and 21,000 examined.*
- What is the response rate? *85% for interviews and 78% for exams. These are relatively high!*
